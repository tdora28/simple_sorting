Bubble sort / Selection sort are simplest sorting algorithms.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

## Specs/Requirements:

- Use ReactJS to create your app
- Keep it short and simple, e.g. a textbox where user inputs array and sorting is done according to these items or you can also manually insert array values inside code
- Feel free to use any react component library or hooks e.g. useState, useMemo
- Use whatever css, styling you learned in other courses
- You may use CSS framework if needed e.g. React Bootstrap / Material UI or whatever for styling GUI

- Optional: use both or more than one sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble and selection sort)
